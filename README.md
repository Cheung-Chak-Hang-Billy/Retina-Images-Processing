## Overview
This project focuses on the field of retina image processing, a crucial area in medical imaging and computer vision. The human retina plays a vital role in visual perception, and analyzing retinal images can provide valuable insights into various ocular diseases and conditions.

Retina image processing involves the application of advanced computational techniques, including deep learning to extract meaningful information from retinal images. By analyzing these images, healthcare professionals can detect abnormalities, track disease progression, and make informed decisions for diagnosis and treatment.

The goal of this project is to develop and showcase deep learning models and techniques for retinal image analysis. By leveraging state-of-the-art neural networks and image processing methodologies, we aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing retinal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma.
